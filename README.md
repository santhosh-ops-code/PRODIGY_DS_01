# 🏠 PRODIGY_DS_01 - House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This task involves building a linear regression model to predict house prices based on:
- GrLivArea (Above ground living area)
- BedroomAbvGr (Number of bedrooms)
- FullBath (Number of full bathrooms)

## 📁 Files
- `house_price_regression.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with code and analysis
- `house_predictions.csv`: Output file with predicted prices
- `train.csv`: Original dataset from Kaggle (link provided)

## 🚀 Output
- MSE and R² Score for model performance
- Scatter plot comparing actual vs predicted prices

## 📊 Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn

## 📎 Dataset
[Kaggle Competition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)
